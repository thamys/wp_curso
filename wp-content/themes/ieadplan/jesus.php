                    <p>The understanding of Christ is hugely important. Most importantly because it relates to our decision that we have made to be in relationship with Christ.</p>
                    <p>But who is He? What sort of man is this?</p>
                    <p>“The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.” (Colossians 1:15)</p>
                    <p>I can imagine local people everywhere when Jesus showed up talking, speculating, arguing, ideologising… Did you hear…, It is said of him that… Did you know…? Especially the religious people of the day, the teachers of the law. Wherever He was, if he opened His mouth or did something, He was the talk of the town.</p>

                    <p>When Jesus calms the storm in Matthew 8:27 the disciples said “what sort of man is this, which even the winds and the sea obey him?”</p>
                    <p>Jesus was incomparable. We always try to compare public figures with similar people in history because we like to categorize in order to have a reference point.</p>
                    <p>Examples: a leader like Winston Churchill; a visionary like John F. Kennedy; a carer like Mother Theresa; a wise man like Ghandi….</p>
                    <p>When the questions above are personalized, it becomes the most important question you and I will ever be asked or have to answer. Who is Jesus? Or more importantly who is Jesus to YOU?<br>
                        Jesus said, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” (John 10:10)</p>

                    <p>It seems very obvious to say that the deity of Christ gives us strength and confidence. He is all powerful, all-knowing and omnipresent. All authority in heaven and on earth is given to Him. What we tend to neglect is that Christ’s humanity gives us as much confidence as His deity.</p>
                    <p>First of all Christ’s humanity is not an emergency solution, God’s last option to save humanity.</p>
                    <p>Man is made in the image of God and Jesus Christ is the perfection of that image. Therefore His humanity is the perfect sovereign will of God.</p>
                    <p>His humanity affirms us as humans and confirms that God has got a plan for mankind.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, His perfect humanity shows us our full potential!! It is wrong to say, “I’m just human.” Or, “They’re only human.” There is no “only” about it. Jesus has provided the wonderful potential of perfected humanity &ndash; and given us His Spirit to help us become like Him.</p>

                    <p>After reading the above we must ask “What must I do to be saved?” This question was asked of Paul from his jailer. The answer was simple, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.” (Acts 16:30)</p>
                    <p>So how do you do that? Jesus answers that question in John 14:6, “Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” So we must believe that “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” (Romans 10:13)</p>
                    <p><strong>Dear God,</strong><br>
                        <strong>I’m praying this prayer because I know that I have done wrong. Please forgive me of all the things I have done wrong in the past.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Help me to put you as Lord of my life and keep me focused on the plans you have for me. I believe in my heart and confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord and now He is Lord over my life.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Thank you for saving me. Thank you that I am now a Christian.</strong><br>
                        <strong>Amen</strong></p>
